# Additions
## Blocks
* Added Baron Sand

## Tags
* Added the `c:flying` EntityType tag

# Changes
* Updated to Minecraft 1.21 (this was a _big_ port)

## Blocks
* Renamed Netherrack Runium Ore to Nether Runium Ore to better fit vanilla conventions[^8]

## Items
* All AoA item custom properties (notably, weapons) have been moved to data components. This means they can now be configured via /give or similar commands
* Trophies can now be renamed if wanted

## Tags
* All common tags have been moved to the `c` namespace, per the new standard between Fabric and NeoForge
* Moved all entities with types (undead, arthropod, etc) to the new Tag system
* Moved swords from the AoA swords tag to the vanilla one
* Moved Extraction's trainable blocks to its own tag
* Moved Cooked Charger Shank, Cooker Halycon Beef, Fiery Chops, and Hot Rod to the `minecraft:meat` tag
* Moved the `rawmeats` tagged items to the new `c:foods/raw_meats` tag
* Moved the `rawfish` tagged items to the new `c:foods/raw_fishes` tag
* Moved the `cookies` tagged items to the new `c:foods/cookies` tag
* Moved the `candy` tagged items to the new `c:foods/candies` tag
* Deinotherium, Horndron, and Opteryx all use a tag-based food now as opposed to a hardcoded item

## Entities
* Stone Giant is now fire-immune
* Changed the default client tracking ranges of all AoA monsters to 8 chunks (up from 5)
* Changed the default client tracking ranges of all AoA NPCs to 10 chunks (up from 5)

## Other
* Modernised AoA's internals for particles. It should be a 1:1 change, so you shouldn't notice any difference, but I may have mistranslated something (let me know)
* Reworked the AoA wiki command to account for Fandom changes and to provide more accurate results
* Improved the visibility of the damage-type icons AoA adds to TES damage particles

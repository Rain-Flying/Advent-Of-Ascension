An enormous crab-like creature from the Barathos flats, the Arkback lives almost exclusively in the least habitable desert areas of Barathos.
Its giant frame, bulky mass, and incredibly dense exoskeleton gives this creature an unparalleled natural protection, protecting it from the harsh environment it lives in.

Its giant back plate naturally collects sand from the buffeting winds of the Barathos sandstorms, and it uses that collected sand to regulate its temperature,
before shaking it off when no longer needed.

Its bulk would position it as a formidable predator, but its life is notably peaceful, seemingly completely unconcerned by even direct attackers, focussing more on
bearing down into a protective stance when hurt too much, before continuing on.

These enormous aggressive fish inhabit the oceans of Precasia, casually roaming in search of food.
Their general demeanor and body structure appears to indicate somewhat of a relationship to standard sharks, and their heterocercal tail fin does help confirm that theory.

While generally found slowly roaming the ocean, they are quick to react and have excellent senses, able to sense and track prey from a long distance.
They then utilise this to approach at a deceptively rapid speed, quickly using its strong jaw to inflict a substantial amount of damage in every bite.

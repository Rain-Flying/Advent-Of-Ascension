King chargers are much like normal chargers, with the exception that they're significantly larger, wear a crown, and rule the roost.
Avoid these at all costs, as their increased stamina, strength, and speed is enough to challenge any unprepared adventurer.

Their natural Charger instincts are present, and they will attack in much the same way normal charges will.
Additionally, a threat to them is considered a threat to the nest, and so it won't take long for nearby Chargers to show themselves and aid their king.

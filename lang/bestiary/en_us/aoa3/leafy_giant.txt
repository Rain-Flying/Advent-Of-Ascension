Relative of the Wood Giant; Leafy Giants are enormous woodland monstrosities that roam leafy forests and take control of the local food chain.
They appear to be the same species of creature as Wood Giants, with a random mutation at birth causing them to grow natural foliage on their bodies. It is not known why this occurs.

They are not aggressive by default, except when hunting, but they will aggressively defend themselves if provoked.
Provoking them is... not a good idea. They seem to form a magical bond with Bush Babies, which causes them to eject themselves from the giant's foliage and attack anything they feel like.
If enraged enough, they will active some form of magical ability that keeps them near-invulnerable once the Bush Babies have left their nest, forcing them to be faced first so that the magical bond can be broken and the protection removed.

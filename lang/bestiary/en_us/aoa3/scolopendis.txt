Scolopendis is an arthropod insect of fear-inducing proportions, typically found in the damp undergrounds of Precasia.
Its large size and carnivorous nature gives it a penchant for eating other large creatures, using its enormous pincers to bisect victims before gradually eating through the corpse.

Its bite can occasionally include a mild nerve agent that causes dizzyness and confusion for a short time, but is otherwise mostly harmless.

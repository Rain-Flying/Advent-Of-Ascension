An enigmatic being, the Skill Master is found in the utility room of the Nowhere world hub.

They do not communicate, and instead just offer to trade skill-related items for Archaic Tokens, a currency seemingly native to Nowhere.
It's not known if Skill Master has any knowledge of or relation to the previous inhabitants of the area, but their interest in Archaic Tokens specifically indicates at least a formative knowledge
of the dimension's history.

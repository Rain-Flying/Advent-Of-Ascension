An incredibly bulky and tough creature from the Precasian wilds, this beast is so rarely seen naturally that it is often considered to be extinct.
Specialised horns were once developed to generate a sound that is known to attract any if they are nearby, though they are only known to historians as none have actually been found.

Tyrosaur has incredibly strong armour plating which it puts to great use in preventing most damage, and anything attempting to take one down would have to find a way to break through before
they would have any hope of winning a fight.
Additionally, they were known to have some form of magical or sonic resonance with the ground and soil, as it is said they were able to easily manipulate the ground underneath it to devastating effect for either defence or offence.
Outside of those distinct features, Tyrosaur is a fairly typical bulky quadruped that is generally territorial and direct confrontation should be avoided, though sightings should be reported to any Cae'alu representative you know.

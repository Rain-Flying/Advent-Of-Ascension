A hulking giant seemingly made entirely from ice, this monstrosity can be rarely found wandering around the coldest of wastelands, ruling as king of the food chain in the area.
Они не любят конкурировать за территорию с другими особями своего вида и плохо работают вместе, поэтому в обычном случае вы увидите их в одиночной изоляции.

Despite their enormous size and incompatibility with other Ice Giants, they are generally not inclined to attack at random, and instead only hunt for food as necessary, or in retaliation if attacked first.
Don't assume this means they are lacking in the combat department however, as they are more than capable of wiping out even the most prepared invaders if provoked.

This oversized swine is an evolutionarily gifted variant of the Piglin-kin residents of the Nether.
Like all Piglins, it has a particular interest in gold items, its obsession often to its own detriment.

Its unusual size does give it a proportionately impressive strength and fortitude, to which it uses in consuming certain gold items, somehow using them to gain back lost vitality.
The mechanism through which it does this is unknown.

Despite being part of an infamously short-tempered species, it is unique in that it doesn't seem overly interested in direct combat.
Instead, it summons helper monsters to do the fighting for it whilst occasionally throwing out lazy magical fireballs.

An alien abomination of fire and magic, this monstrosity is one of the fiercest creatures in the Nether.
Its hulking form is an amalgamation of the fire and lava of the Nether it lives in, and an otherworldly composite that makes up its bones, in the shape of an intimidating monster.

Despite its intimidating form and impressive power, it's not at all aggressive unless provoked.
It's suspected that these beings are not strictly natives to the Nether, and instead were created during the last great dimensional clash through a spike of magical energy.
Nevertheless, they are a devastatingly dangerous creature that should not be provoked at any cost.

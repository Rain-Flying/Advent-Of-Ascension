A huge elemental-like creature dripping in sand and rock, this monster seems to be made from the sand itself rather than the rocks, and instead has picked up rocks in its travels to offer additional structure.
They are usually only found in desert-like areas, and are almost always spotted wandering alone.

While not inherently aggressive, they will retaliate viciously if provoked, creating traps from its own and environmental sand, trapping and impaling enemies with relentless abandon.
It is recommended to let these creatures roam in peace, to save a slow and painful death.

An over-sized stone elemental that rules the mountaintops of the Overworld. Finding one of these awe-inspiring creatures in the wild is a rare opportunity, given their solitary nature.
Standing well and truly above the head of any human, they use their large tough bodies as a form of intimidation, to great effect.

They are not known for acts of aggression, however they will defend themselves vigorously if attacked, and will happily chase down fleeing victims.

It utilises its incredibly tough body to resist incoming attacks, which it does both as a form of defense, and in effort to protect its little friends.
Stone Giants appear to allow Silverfish to hide away inside its body, presumably as a means of protect and safe habitat. Once disturbed, they will jump out of the giant's body and help their protector fend off the attacker until successful.
They can also return to the giant's body to assist with repairing its stone body, which further increases its deadliness.

A small, agile hunter creature that aggressively hunts in packs and has an unending appetite.
Veloraptors are usually found in small groups roaming open plains or forests and jungles looking for prey to eat.

It uses its sharp teeth and claws in rapid attacks that can quickly bring down even the toughest of beasts.
Watch out for their leap, as it can catch prepared adventurers unaware.

Like most of the creatures of Precasia; it is mostly active during the day, and tend to slow down and rest at night.

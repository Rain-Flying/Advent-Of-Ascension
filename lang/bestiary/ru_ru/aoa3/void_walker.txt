An alien and almost eldritch-like being, these bipedal creatures hide in the darkness of the deep underground, roaming the caves and caverns in wait for prey.
They often have shards of Amethyst embedded in their skin, which it is believed they use as both a form of defense and offense.

Their special hide is useful as a crafting material due to its strength and resilience - if you can manage to obtain some.

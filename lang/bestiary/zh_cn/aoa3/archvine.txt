食人花是另一种变异的花园生物，这种植物原本是一种诱捕型食肉植物。
行走的时候，它的脚会扎根于地里，然后每走一步就把根折断。它会利用这些根从它所到之处汲取养分。 It uses these roots to draw nutrients from the ground wherever it stands.

Like all other mutated Gardencian creatures, the Archvine is extremely aggressive. Due to their greatly increased regenerative powers as a result of their rooting mechanism, Archvines are very resistant to attack and will prove very dangerous to even experienced fighters.

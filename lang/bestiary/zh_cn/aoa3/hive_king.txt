爵士维度的荒芜沙漠并不适合生物生存，水源和食物都十分的匮乏，只有那些强于适应的生物才能够在这里存活。
To this end, insects are extremely prevalent across the land, as their ability to survive off minimal resources gives them a great advantage over their mammalian counterparts.

The Hive King is a creature so aptly named because of its extreme similarities to hive queens of many insect species. The key difference here though, is that rather than the workers of the colony defending the hive, the Hive King defends it single-handedly, and to devastating effect.
因此，工蜂们被留下来繁衍后代以延续蜂巢，而蜂王则扮演着某种沉睡的守护者的角色。

一旦醒来，蜂王会利用它坚硬的外壳和锋利的钳子来击败它的对手，恶毒地攻击任何进入蜂巢的入侵者，直到他们彻底死去。
Workers that notice the Hive King's offense may sometimes come to its aid, adding even more trouble to whichever poor creature made the mistake of venturing within.

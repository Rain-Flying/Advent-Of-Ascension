A green and white snail from Candyland, this peaceful creature very slowly crawls across the ground doing not much at all. They can sometimes be seen cleaning up some dead grass or leaves, as their sole source of food - however they don't tend to eat a lot.
和其他来自糖果的生物一样，留兰香蜗牛闻起来非常像他们的同名糖果：留兰香。当然，和其他生物一样，它们的气味具有欺骗性。当它们被舔的时候，尝起来更像是蜗牛，而不是糖果。 As usual though, their smell is deceptive, and when licked they taste much more like a snail than they do candy.
